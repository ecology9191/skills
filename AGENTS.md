Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/` — daily code work
- `productivity/` — daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/` — kept around but rarely used
- `personal/` — tied to my own setup, not promoted
- `in-progress/` — drafts not yet ready to ship
- `deprecated/` — no longer used

Every skill in `engineering/`, `productivity/`, or `misc/` must have a reference in the top-level `README.md`. Those three bucket folders are exposed to opencode through `opencode.json`. Skills in `personal/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` must not appear in the top-level `README.md` or in `opencode.json` skill paths.

Promoted skills must also appear in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so `npx skills add` shows the bucket-grouped install menu. After adding or moving a promoted skill, run `npm run generate:marketplace` and commit the updated manifest. Non-promoted skills must set `metadata.internal: true` in their `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. Bucket `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**.

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). For the full definitions, description conventions, and why a user-invoked skill can invoke model-invoked skills but never another user-invoked one, see [docs/invocation.md](./docs/invocation.md).

To (re)link every skill into the local harness skill directories (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` keeps installed skills current; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill.
